    For a long time, I’ve yearned for a space to share the thoughts that dance through my mind —
    whether it’s pondering the meaning of life or questioning why hot food feels like a hug.
    This blog is my attempt to blur the lines between the personal, academic, and professional.
    Welcome to a little corner of myself. 🌸

  <BlogCard blogPath="/EllieCompBio/posts/here-i-am" blogTitle="Here I Am">
    <p>The first post in this space — an introduction, a reflection, a beginning.</p>
