Sitting in a coffee shop in Pittsburgh, PA, I start to wonder. My thoughts gush like a whirlwind trapped inside a crowded office, yet I still manage to sip my tiramisu latte and begin typing. To my right is Annie, sporting her brown boots, green sweater, and gorgeous blue dégradé nails. In front of me, Alisa is celebrating—and complaining—about getting accepted for a short talk she’d rather not give, because she’s aspiring—as she should—for an even better opportunity. And then, here I am, not even sure what I’m supposed to be doing.

Why is it that I tend to undermine myself when those I admire hold me in such high esteem? I guess it’s something that’s become ingrained in my soul. In my—almost—31 years of existence, I’ve validated my worth by comparing it to what I feel is expected of me. And even though I often fail that assessment, here I am. This is why—surrounded by the two most valuable friends I’ve ever had—I dare to go down this rabbit hole of self-doubt and self-deprecation, aiming to come out the other side none the wiser, but with a nice story to tell nonetheless.

Do you ever get that feeling where you’re almost there, but just missing an inch, a penny, a whisker to make it? I think that’s the best way to express this weight I carry on my back all the time. Maybe it’s the ridiculously high expectations I impose on myself, but I feel like I have this huge well of potential—and I never quite make it a reality. Ideas flood my head constantly—ideas about how I could make a huge impact—but at the end of the day, they stay as ephemeral and ghostly as wishes. I say this, but if you asked any of the girls sitting beside me, they’d point out how wrong I am.

For those who don’t know me, my name is Luisa Escobar-Robledo. I go by Ellie when speaking in English—a little play on how my initials sound when spelled out. I’m an M.D., even if I don’t feel like one. I have a master’s in Data Science and Analytics, even if I don’t feel like that’s anything to be proud of. And I’m a woman, even if I feel like I don’t deserve to be one. And even while feeling the burning pain of never being enough—here I am. Just being here, it feels stupid to admit I feel vulnerable. To admit that even with overwhelming evidence that I’m just a normal human being, I still feel like I’m not.

I tell my patients that it’s okay to feel sick—that mental illness is real—and that recognizing it affects you doesn’t undermine who you are. I tell this to my friends, my family, my partner… but I never seem to believe it for myself. As I write this, I feel an anger swelling deep inside me, telling me I’m stupid for even thinking this way. “How can you practice medicine if you’re not healthy yourself?” “How can you expect to help others if you need help too?” “So toughen up and tighten up, butterfly—you’ve got nothing to complain about.” I think being handed the responsibility of carrying out my father’s supposed will while he was away might have reinforced this way of thinking. I still need to work on breaking these bad habits of mine. Because no matter how hard I try to hold everything back and just push through, the dam behind my eyes always feels one step away from breaking—but it never does.

Funny how I feel like it’s never enough—and even with everything that’s consuming me, it still doesn’t feel like enough to finally break into tears. I guess, in a way, that’s part of the beauty of humankind. We’ve evolved to be so self-aware that in that awareness, we end up hurting ourselves—judging who we are against who we think we’re supposed to be. A beautiful yet daunting feeling: the anguish of existence, felt only by those lucky enough to be alive. Because even when I’m handed all the tools, and the road ahead is clear, here I am—still standing in my own way.

But then again, here I am. Even if my inner voice shouts that I don’t deserve it, here I am—wearing a beautiful pair of black boots and a tight black skirt. Daring myself to be vulnerable enough to lay all of my insecurities in digital ink, and to fight the voice in my head that calls me stupid for even thinking there’s an obstacle I’m struggling to get through. I used to envy how women could show their vulnerability when men couldn’t—and now that I am a woman, the only thing stopping me from being fragile is my own mind. It might sound like a joke, but the punchline is that I’m my worst enemy.

What a clichéd way to look at things—but I guess clichés are clichés for a reason. Recognizing that I’m the one in my own way is the first step toward moving forward. Or at least, I hope it is. Right now, I can boil it down to two competing desires inside me: I wish I could skip ahead to when my transition is complete, but I also know I need to make the most of each day so I can truly move forward with my research. It’s hard to admit that even going to lab and trying to seize the day feels like such a bore when all I want is to go to bed and wake up a year from now. I’m waiting for the day I can look in the mirror and just see me—the day I finally step out of this limbo, no longer trapped in old skin I haven’t finished shedding. But then the awful thought creeps in: will that day ever come? Will I ever be satisfied? Will I ever be enough—enough for myself to finally get out of my own way, and just admit that I am, simply, amazing?

I want to get away from this feeling—and the best way I know how is to pretend it doesn’t exist. So I chase the only time I’m not reminded of this inner conflict: that sweet spot of falling asleep before the nightmares come and bring it all back again. Then it’s time to start the week, take my thousand and one pills, and force myself through the motions of the day. Absently, I move through the week, focusing on meager tasks that could be done in a day—but I’m lucky if I finish them before Sunday night, when it’s time to fill my pill case and start it all over again. But the feeling is still there. It only grows the more I ignore it. Life gets duller, tears press harder, screaming to be let out. And all that said—here I am.

Me, Ellie. Just a human. Just a trans girl. Just me, trying my best to live. I fight my biggest enemy—myself—pushing to recognize that I’m not perfect, that I have a ton of flaws. I overcommit. I underdeliver. I’m way too hard on myself. And yes—it’s me who gets in my own way. But I know I’m not alone in this. If I shared this, I’m sure many would resonate with these feelings, would recognize that being your own obstacle is part of being self-aware. Part of striving to be better. Of trying to belong in a society I want to be part of—even when the fear of not belonging turns into a self-fulfilling prophecy that pushes me further away.

I need to remind myself: crying to a friend doesn’t mean I can’t be there for them later. Being sick doesn’t disqualify me from helping others feel better. Being vulnerable doesn’t mean I don’t deserve to be sitting here. Because the truth is: here I am. And here I’ll stay—for as long as I need to.
